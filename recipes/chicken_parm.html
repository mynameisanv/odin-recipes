    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My personal favorite italian dish, and one of the most famous non-pasta dishes
        (though often served on a bed of pasta) this meal combines two of my most
        favorite things in the world: melted cheese and crispy fried chicken. Always a nice
        delicacy that's perfect for a date night or a nice meal for the family to 
        celebrate a special occasion!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 boneless, skinless chicken breast half</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>½ large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to <strong>450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a <strong>thickness of 1/2-inch</strong>. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and <strong>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese</strong> in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for <strong>10 to 15 minutes</strong>.</li>
        <li>Heat <strong>1/2 inch olive oil</strong> in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about <strong>2 minutes per side</strong>. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with <strong>2 tablespoons tomato sauce</strong>. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with <strong>1/2 teaspoon olive oil</strong>.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, <strong>15 to 20 minutes</strong>. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <strong>165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
