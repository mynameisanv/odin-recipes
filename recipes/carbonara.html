    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple italian dish uses just 4 ingredients and results in a delicious,
        creamy pasta dish that will take your tastebuds on an adventure. This dish hails from
        Rome and has been one of the most popular italian dishes to date. Though it can be
        a bit tricky to figure out how to create the creamy sauce without breaking or
        splitting it, it is well worth the effort to learn how to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. Kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 oz. guancale, pancetta, or bacon</li>
        <li>2 oz. Parmesan</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. Pasta of Your Choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat <strong>6 qt. water</strong> in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add <strong>3 Tbsp. salt</strong> and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
        <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove <strong>4 oz. guanciale</strong> from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate <strong>2 oz. cheese</strong> and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
        <li>Whisk <strong>4 egg yolks</strong> and <strong>2 whole eggs</strong> in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of <strong>pepper</strong> and set aside.</li>
        <li>Working next to pot, heat <strong>2 Tbsp. oil</strong> in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, <strong>7–10 minutes</strong>.</li> 
        <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back <strong>about 3 Tbsp</strong>. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
        <li>Cook <strong>1 lb. pasta</strong> in boiling water, stirring occasionally, <strong>2 minutes sh</strong>y of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid</strong> to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about <strong>2 minutes</strong>. Remove pot from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk <strong>¼ cup pasta cooking liquid</strong> into reserved egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>
        <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
    </ol>
